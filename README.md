# Lattice Experiments using Fermionic Operators and the Variational Eigensolver in a Quantum Computer
by Wladimir Silva

## Introduction
This work describes a series of experiments in IBM’s 16-qubit Guadalupe quantum processor to find the ground state of various lattice systems implemented in the Qiskit library. We aim to design a Variational Quantum Eigensolver (QVE) resistant to noise and independent of the number of vertices in the lattice. Furthermore, we test our solution against two Ising models very important in the study of critical points and phase transitions of magnetic systems as well as high-temperature superconductors, and quantum magnetism and charge density. We provide complete result metrics including final energies, precision percentages, execution times, angular parameters and source code for experimentation. Let’s get started.
